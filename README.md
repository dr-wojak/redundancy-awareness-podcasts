# **Public Interest Audio & Briefings**

## **Evidence, Decision Systems, and Governance Under Strain**

Welcome. This page brings together a curated set of **audio briefings, talks, and supporting materials** that examine how complex decisions are made inside the Irish State — and what happens when evidence, systems thinking, and operational methods are persistently excluded from that process.

This material is published **in the public interest**. It is not party-political, not ideological, and not retrospective advocacy. Its focus is technical: **how information flows, how risk is processed, and how decisions are operationalised (or not) in real institutions**.

The recordings span nearly two decades of analysis and engagement, across domains including defence, foreign affairs, public administration, infrastructure, and emergency planning. Together, they form a practical record of how warnings, models, and proposals entered the system — and how they stalled.

## **How to Use This Page**

You do not need to listen to everything. The collection is designed for **modular access**:

* Short explainers (8–20 minutes) introduce core ideas  
* Longer discussions (45–60 minutes) explore systemic failure modes in depth  
* Scripts and transcripts support citation, verification, and reuse

Journalists, researchers, civil servants, policymakers, and members of the public can each approach this material at their own pace and depth.

### **📄 Supporting Material**

Primary-source documentation underlying the formal submissions.

This archive exists because those conditions repeatedly failed — quietly, procedurally, and without public visibility.

All materials here are:

* Public  
* Sourceable  
* Time-stamped  
* Presented in good faith

They are made available so that others — inside and outside the State — can examine what happened, draw their own conclusions, and decide how such failures might be avoided in future.

## **Start Anywhere**

There is no required order. If you are new, consider beginning with one of the shorter recordings. If you are researching or reporting, the scripts and longer discussions provide deeper technical context.

This is not about assigning blame. It is about understanding **how systems fail — and how they could work better**.
